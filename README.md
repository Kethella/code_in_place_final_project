# code_in_place_final_project

This is my final project to the online course Code in Place offered by Stanford University. After 1 month of learning the basics of coding with Karel and Python, I am happy to present my final project to you guys. I hope you like it!

More about the game:
I wanted to create something that could be fun and usable. That is why I decided to create a game. It is interactive and integrative, people can play it with other people and have fun. I created with a goal to be for kids, but according to the photos library it can also be anything you want! You just have to change the photos library on top of the code.

To change the photos you just need to put the path of the file with the images that you want to use, and then it will be in a list and matched with the random number.


P.s. Thanks for the Code in Place team! It was awesome to be part of the students group. I was a totally beginner and you help me a lot, not just learning the basics of coding but also to be more interested in the profession in the future! Thanks guys!
